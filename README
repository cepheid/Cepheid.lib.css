CSS RESET AND FRAMEWORK

by Steve Svoboda

Mission:
This framework is for my personal use so I have a quick set of CSS classes available to me at a moment's notice. 

Margins and padding, widths and font size classes are typically divisible by 3, so regardless of the number of columns you're using in something like a 360/480/960 layout, everything should line up and look pretty.
